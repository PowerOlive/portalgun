HOW TO INSTALL THIS MOD:
  1. Find your minetest folder, and create it if there isn't one yet (like if this is your first time installing a mod)
    Linux: It depends on what type of install you did.
      "RUN_IN_PLACE" installation, the path is:
        <directory where you insalled Minetest/mods
      If you have a normal "globally installed" Minetest, then the path is:
        <your home directory>/.minetest/mods
    Windows:
      <directory where you insalled Minetest/mods
    MacOS X:
      <your home directory>/Library/Application Support/minetest/mods
  2. If you didn't find a folder in step 1, you have to create the folder. If this your first time installing a mod?
  3. Make a folder inside your "mods" folder called "portalgun". All the portalgun files go in that folder.


REVISION HISTORY
 20150709 UjEdwin: Version 0.5. This is not a complitle version, so
still missing functions :)
 Feel Free to use the code and make a better version, I dont care :)

 20151006 mrob27: Reformat everything (spaces, tabs, indentation,
etc.). Use right-click for shooting orange portals. You can now only
shoot portals onto steel blocks.

HOW TO PLAY:
 At present the only way to get a portal gun is to play Creative mode
and get one in the inventory screen, or give one to yourself using
"/giveme portalgun:gun"
 left-click to shoot blue portal
 right-click to shoot orange portal
 shift+left-click to close both portals
 Portals may only be anchored on steel blocks (which sort of look like
the walls of the Aperture Science test chambers)
